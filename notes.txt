#Python is a general purpose programming Language that is interpreted dynamic and has garbage collecttion. it follows
#an OOP paradigm.
#General purpose: it can be used for many other things
#code checking for an interpreted languange is done during run time .
#compilation means the number would be stepped down into byte code but in case of python, it is intepreted not compiled
#python is loosely typed.
#garbage collection: by declaring a variable, you have opened up a memeory in your ram. if in your #operations you are not making reference to the declared variable. so python garabage collects it so it #doesnt take space.
#different paradigm in programning: We have procedural, functional and class
#There a r 2 data types in python: Primitive and Non-Primitive
#primitive data types are- strings, integers, floats, boolean
#strings: Are combinations of different characters. Note that Python considers only ASCII characters(Amercan Standard for Code Information Interchange).
#examples of operations in strings
#strings are operated while enclosed in a single or double quote.
#For example print("sister tolu") is the same thing as print('sister tolu')
#string is best worked on can be regarded as best practices if it is stored in a variable. 

#methods on strings, these are functions that are used to manipulate strings.
#1. Len Method: this is used to check the size or length of a astring
#2. Lower method. This is used to convert all casing to lower in string 
#3. Upper method. This is used to convert all casing to upper in string 
#4. Title Method: This is used to convert every 1st alphabet to uppercase
#5, Capitalized method: This is used to change the 1st alphabet to upper case.

#integers
#iNTEGERS are whole numbers without decimal points..They are also known as non-floating point number
#Operators on integers
#+ for addition
#-for substraction 
#/for division
#% for modulus
#*for multiplication
#**for  raise to the power

#== is for comparison
#= is for 

#simulate a program with Python that prints out sister Tolu receive 3.50 naira change. Note that sister tolu bought
# a product from a super store. You can name the product tooth paste and she pays 100 naira and receieve 3.50 naira change
